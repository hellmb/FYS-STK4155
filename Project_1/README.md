# Project 1: Regression analysis and resampling methods
## Overview:
This project investigates different regression methods by studying how they fit to a generated data set as well as real data. The methods investigated includes the Ordinary Least Squares method, Ridge regression and Lasso regression. Polynomials are fitted to the two-dimensional Franke function, as well as real digital terrain data from the Oslo area. The models are then assessed by employing the bootstrap resampling technique.

## Running the code:
In order to run the model, the python script main.py is run in the terminal. The program takes one input argument from the command line; 'franke' or 'terrain' depending on what data set the user would like to predict.

### Additional note:
In order to save the figures, the user needs to have an additional folder "Figures/" in the run directory.
