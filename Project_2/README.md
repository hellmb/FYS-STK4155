# Project 2: Classification and regression with neural networks
## Overview:
This project investigates both classification and regression problems by developing a logistic regression code and a feed-forward neural network. For the classification part of the project, a credit card data set is used to compare the logistic regression model and the neural network. The regression part of the project includes modifying the neural network to take the Franke function and perform linear regression.

## Code:
The models are run through main.py, which takes an input argument. Supported arguments are 'log' for running the logisitic regression model, 'nn' for running the classification neural network and 'linreg' for running the linear regression neural network.

### Additional note:
In order to save the figures, the user needs to have an additional folder "Figures/" in the run directory.
